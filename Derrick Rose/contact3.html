                <h2>Injuries and Trades</h2> 
                <p>In the strike-shortened 2011-12 season, Rose led the Bulls to the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. But in the first game of the postseason, Rose went down with a serious knee injury that forced him to miss the remainder of the playoffs as well as all of the 2012-13 season.

                    Returning to NBA action for the start of the 2013-14 season, Rose lasted just 10 games before tearing his right knee meniscus, a repeat of which knocked him out of action for significant time the following season. He remained healthy enough to play in 66 out of 82 games in 2015-16, though his scoring average dropped to 16.4 points per game.
                    
                    Rose's tenure with the Bulls came to an end in June 2016, when he was traded to the New York Knicks. He bumped his scoring average up to 18 points per game with the Knicks, but also ignited controversy with an unexplained absence from the club in January 2017, and finished the season with another torn meniscus.
                    
                    Moving on to the Cleveland Cavaliers, Rose briefly left the club early in the 2017-18 season, his injury woes reportedly causing him to consider retirement. Traded to the Utah Jazz in February 2018, he was waived by his new club just two days later. Rose then joined the Minnesota Timberwolves the following month, and remained with the club for the 2018-19 season.
                    
                    After signing with the Detroit Pistons in July 2019, Rose showed he still had plenty left in the tank by scoring at least 20 points in a career-best 14 consecutive games.</p>
