                <h2>Early Years</h2>
                <p>Derrick Martell Rose was born on October 4, 1988, in Chicago, Illinois. Raised without a father in the tough Englewood section of Chicago, Rose and his three older brothers were under the constant, watchful eye of their strict and loving mother, Brenda.
                    "My mom would walk down the street and drag us home if she heard we were getting into trouble," Rose later told Sports Illustrated. "Even the drug dealers, when they saw her coming, would stop dealing and tell her where we were."

The Rose family was tight, and Derrick's three brothers—Dwayne, Reggie and Allan—took on a fatherly role when it came to their youngest brother. By the eighth grade, Rose's talent as a basketball player was readily apparent. The slick-moving point guard with exceptional court vision was a rising star in his home city, and to protect him from outside interests, his older siblings were constantly at his side. One or more would pick him up and drop him off at school. They also attended his practices and punished him if he stepped out of line.

In 2003, Rose enrolled at Chicago's Simeon Academy and quickly catapulted to one of the country's best high school players. His dominant career at the school resulted in numerous wins and awards. In his senior season, Rose, who by then was ranked as the nation's best high school point guard, averaged 25.2 points 
per game and guided Simeon to a 33-2 record and its second consecutive state title. That same year, the Chicago Tribune named Rose its 2007 "Illinois Mr. Basketball."
